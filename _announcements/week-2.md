**Statistics and Data Science: A Brief Overview**

Statistics and data science are closely connected fields that play a crucial role in understanding and making sense of data in today’s information-driven world.

**Statistics** is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides the theoretical foundation for making informed decisions based on data, using tools such as probability theory, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and more.

**Data Science**, on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical methods with computer science, data engineering, and domain expertise to extract insights and knowledge from large and complex datasets. It involves techniques from machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence, often using programming languages like Python or R.

In essence, while statistics focuses on understanding data through mathematical rigor, data science uses those statistical principles—along with computational power—to solve real-world problems, build predictive models, and drive data-informed decision-making across industries.
